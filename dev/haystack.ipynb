Both\\nsocial and energy policy mechanisms are needed [27]. Imple-\\nmenting energy efficiency schemes in households can reduce en-\\nergy poverty, through using ETS carbon revenues for directly\\nsubsidising energy efficiency actions, including building insulation,\\nefficient housing appliances, heating and cooling systems, and the\\nuptake of renewable energy systems. National energy efficiency\\nschemes can facilitate increased rate and deepness of building\\ninsulation. Some programmes provide support to avoid inefficient\\nand expensive space heating through the replacement of old\\nboilers. The deployment of renewable energy and energy storage\\nmay allow energy poor households to produce and store energy for\\nself-consumption in a decentralized way, while counteracting high\\nenergy prices [30].\\nEnergy efficiency can be further improved through energy au-\\ndits, while trained personnel can advise low-income households on\\nhow to reduce their energy consumption.
